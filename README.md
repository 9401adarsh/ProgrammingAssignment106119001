Question Assigned : Q1. a)

Problem Statement : Write a program to show how basic set operations such as union and intersection can be implemented when set is represented as bit-string.

**Programming Language Used** : ***Python Version 3.8***

**3rd Party Function Used** : **bitset()** function from **bitsets** module in order to create a Universal Set Class and to represent sets as bitstrings.

**Kindly note that the module was only used for storing the sets as bit-strings and creating a Universal Set class. In-built functions for set operations have not being used.**
