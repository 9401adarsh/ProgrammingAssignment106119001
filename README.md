# ProgrammingAssignment106119001


**Question Assigned: Q1. b)

Problem Statement: Show how bitwise operations can be used to find these combinations of A = {a,b,c,d,e},
B = {b,c,d,g,p,t,v}, C = {c,e,i,o,u,x,y,z} & D = {d,e,h,i,n,o,t,u,x,y}
•	A U B
•	A ∩ B
•	(A U D) ∩ (BUC) 
•	A U B U C U D 


**Programming Language Used** : ***Python Version 3.8***

**3rd Party Function Used** : **bitset()** function from **bitsets** module in order to create a Universal Set Class and to represent sets as bitstrings.

**Kindly note that the module was only used for storing the sets as bit-strings and creating a Universal Set class. In-built functions for set operations have not being used.**
